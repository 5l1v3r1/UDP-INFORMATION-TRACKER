# UDP-INFORMATION-TRACKER
With this Python script you can track UDP informations. You can use it in many ways, but the main reason I wrote this script is to troll some people in Skype or Chatroulette e.g.

Installation WINDOWS
1. Download the ZIP-file (https://github.com/SenoxCode/UDP-INFORMATION-TRACKER/archive/master.zip)
2. Open the ZIP and put the folder on your desktop
3. Open the folder
4. Open the "install.bat" (ONLY BY THE FIRST RUN)
5. Edit the "Tracker.py" with an editor (You can use a simple notepad)
6. Change the Value in line 10 to your internet interface (Watch the video above if you don't know how)

How to use it on CHATROULETTE/SKYPE (You need to install it first)
1. Open a website you want to use it (Like Omegle e.g)
2. Start the voice-/text-/videochat
3. Open the "start.bat" file
4. Now you can track the IP's and the location to troll the people
